# Automatic_Bell_System-__IOT_Project
This project implements an Automatic Bell System using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.
The code is written in ardunio c language 
This project is an automated bell system for school, collegee, hospital,public places. here we have shared the source code of the application that we have developed to keep track of time and ring the bell using serial communication. the project solution files are the project files we just copy pasted from ardunio ide.

we developed the prototype of the system we intended to implement using arduino UNO. 
Don't forget to contribute back to this project so folks forking this project after you get an even better starting point. always share what you have accomplished so folks like you and me (coders) can save alot of coding time.

thanks.

Nikhil Disale.
